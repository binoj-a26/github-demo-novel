Chapter 1
The book opens with Nick Carraway, the novel's narrator, introducing himself. He describes his background, his education at Yale and his sense of what he calls moral justice. The reader learns that the events of the novel took place a year earlier and that Nick is recalling them from his memory.

The narrative begins when Nick moves from his home in the Midwest to the fictional West Egg on Long Island, where he rents a small house next door to a large Gothic mansion. Nick has moved there looking for excitement and hopes to make a career as a bond trader.

West Egg is considered unfashionable because it is home to people with “new money”, whose wealth comes from recent success in trade or shares and who consequently have no traditional social connections. Nick discovers that his neighbor is a mysterious millionaire called Gatsby; he knows nothing about Gatsby except that he throws lavish parties every Saturday night.

On the other side of the bay is the more fashionable East Egg, where the more traditionally conservative and aristocratic rich families live. Nick has connections in East Egg, as it is where his cousin Daisy lives with her husband, Tom Buchanan. Nick goes for dinner at the couple's house and meets Tom, a powerful-looking man. He is also introduced to Jordan Baker, a beautiful young woman who is a keen golfer and who often looks distant and bored.

Tom runs out to take a phone call, and Jordan tells Nick that it is Tom's lover. Nick returns home, and when he arrives, he sees his neighbor standing in his garden and stretching his arms out towards the water. Nick looks out, but he can only see a green light marking the end of a dock on the other side of the bay.
